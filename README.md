## 📌 Project Overview

RetailPulse Dashboard is a comprehensive analytics platform built with **Tableau** that empowers business leaders to explore sales, profit, and order trends across categories, time, and regions.  
Through interactive visualizations, users can answer key business questions and drive informed expansion decisions.

## 🔍 Business Problem

A global superstore retailer needs to expand into the **East** region, but first wants to understand its historical performance across existing regions (North, Central, South). Specifically, they want to analyze:
- Total sales, profit, and order volume over time  
- Region-wise and category-wise trends  
- Which customer segments drive the most profit  
- Which subcategories might be underperforming
