## 📌 Project Overview

RetailPulse Dashboard is a comprehensive analytics platform built with **Tableau** that empowers business leaders to explore sales, profit, and order trends across categories, time, and regions.  
Through interactive visualizations, users can answer key business questions and drive informed expansion decisions.

---

## 🔍 Business Problem

A global superstore retailer needs to expand into the **East** region, but first wants to understand its historical performance across existing regions (North, Central, South). Specifically, they want to analyze:
- Total sales, profit, and order volume over time  
- Region-wise and category-wise trends  
- Which customer segments drive the most profit  
- Which subcategories might be underperforming  

---

## 📁 Dataset

We use the classic **Superstore / Retail dataset**, which includes:
- `OrderDate`, `Sales`, `Profit`, `Quantity`  
- `Region`, `Segment`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`  
- Customer and product IDs, shipping info, etc  

You can find a popular version on Kaggle:  
[Superstore Dataset on Kaggle]:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
Another generic “Retail Sales Dataset” with similar structure:  
[Retail Dataset on Kaggle]:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
